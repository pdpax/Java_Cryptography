The king and his men
Stole the queen from her bed
And bound her in her bones
The seas be ours
And by the powers
Where we will, we'll roam

Yo, ho, all together
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die

Now some men have died
And some are alive
And others sail on the sea
â€“ With the keys to the cage...
And the Devil to pay
We lay to Fiddler's Green!

Yo, ho, all hands
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die

The bell has been raised
From its watery grave...
Do you hear its sepulchral tone?
We are a call to all
Pay heed the squall
And turn your sail toward home!
